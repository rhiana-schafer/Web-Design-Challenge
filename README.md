# Web-Design-Challenge

In this assignment, I created a responsive webpage to display weather data. 

In addition to an informative landing page, the site contains:
<ul>
  <li>4 individual sections for various plots </li>
  <li>A comparison page where all can be viewed at once. </li>
  <li>An additional page is present to display the data used to generate the charts </li>

The site was coded using html, css, and bootstrap.
Site features include:
  <li>A navigation bar</li>
  <li>An html table</li>
  <li>Responsivitiy to screen size</li>
